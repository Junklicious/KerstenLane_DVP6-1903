â€‹	Static is an app that allows gamers to find people with similar game interests, both online or in person. It functions by presenting users with profiles of other users that they may be interested in playing with, and allowing them to approve or decline that suggestion. Users are entered into a chat message channel with other users they have matched with so they can setup times to game or just talk. All background data, such as user profiles, is handled through Firebase.
